This is a graphics, sound, and physics demo to show the capabilities of the DynoSprite game engine. This program requires a 512K Coco 3. To play, use the keyboard or a joystick in the right port. Move the joystick or press the arrow keys to scroll the background plane. Bounce the bubbles off of the sides of the screen to increase their energy. Press the first joystick button or the 'Z' key to reload the demo.

To start the demo, LOADM the 'DYNO' program.
