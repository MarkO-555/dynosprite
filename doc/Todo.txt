Possible features to add to DynoSprite engine in future:
 - pause button
 - in-game mute sound toggle key
 - high score list
 - cheat menu
 - sprite collision detection
 - helper functions for dynamically creating/destroying Objects
 - add feature to keep list of background tile locations to update, and then redraw them in main loop
 - implement RowCrop functionality in sprites to support partial sprite draw/erase on top/bottom of screen

Potential improvements to existing features:
 - rewrite audio code to allow 2nd channel to start instantly instead of at next buffer refill
 - reduce sprite code memory by rolling multiple animation frames into single sprite code block
 - modify object processing loop in main.asm to support adding/removing Objects during the processing loop
